PROFESSOR: So here's a quiz--

0:00:02.980,0:00:06.060
depth-first search versus
breadth-first search.

0:00:06.060,0:00:06.870
Two questions--

0:00:06.870,0:00:10.820
first, when might you want to use
breadth-first search instead of

0:00:10.820,0:00:14.600
depth-first search, and then, when might
depth-first search be a better

0:00:14.600,0:00:16.030
choice instead of breadth-first search?
