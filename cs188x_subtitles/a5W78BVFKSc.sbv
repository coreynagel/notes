It hedges its bets.

0:00:02.310,0:00:05.700
It explores kind of a little bit in the
wrong direction, just to be sure

0:00:05.700,0:00:07.150
because the heuristic is imperfect.

0:00:07.150,0:00:11.350
But by and large it does a very small
amount of work, not much worse than

0:00:11.350,0:00:14.430
greedy, and it's optimal.

0:00:14.430,0:00:15.680
So, great.
