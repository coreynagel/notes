DAN KLEIN: Today we're going to continue
talking about constraint

0:00:03.930,0:00:05.500
satisfaction problems.

0:00:05.500,0:00:08.900
And in particular, we're going to go
beyond the basic techniques we talked

0:00:08.900,0:00:13.220
about last time, and talk about methods
for efficiently solving CSPs.

0:00:13.220,0:00:15.780
And then we're going to get into a
general concept of local search.
